# StockMarket 

This project incorporates the 1st and 2nd project developed for AEDA @ FEUP (Algorithms and Data structures)
Project developed with VisualStudio.

StockMarket simulates exactly what it says, a stock market.
Between clients, investors their transactions and orders we can perform basic CRUD operations on structures like priority queues, hash tales and binary search trees,
allowing us to list some or all of the elements we desire and modify them.
