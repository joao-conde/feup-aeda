# Stock Market 

This project incorporates the 1st and 2nd project developed for AEDA @ FEUP (Algorithms and Data structures)
Project developed with VisualStudio 2017.

Stock Market simulates exactly what it says, a stock market.
Multiple clients and investors interact and perform transactions in the stock market, to adquire the most stocks for the least price.

Between clients, investors, their transactions and their orders, we can perform basic CRUD operations on structures like priority queues, hash tables and binary search trees, allowing us to list some or all of the elements we desire and modify them.
